# Vue Cookies Consent Component ðŸš€

A simple and customizable cookies consent component for Vue.js, styled with Tailwind CSS. This component provides options to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or close the consent banner. The consent status is stored in the session storage, and the banner is only visible if the user hasn't consented yet.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
